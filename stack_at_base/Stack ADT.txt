Stack ADT:

S.push(e)
S.pop()
S.top()
S.isEmpty()
len(S)

Example 1: 
Overwrite a given file with its contents line-by-line reversed using a stack. 

Example 2: 
Using a stack check if a given arithmetic expression has matching parenthese.  You may assume the expression only has: 
--> ( and )
--> { and }
--> [ and ]

Example 3:
Use a stack to match tags in a markup language such as html.  Check if a given html file has matching tags.  A simple opening html tag has the form <name> and the corresponding closing tag has the form </name>.  Commonly used html tags are:
--> body: document body
--> h1: section header
--> center: center justify
--> p: paragraph
--> li: list item
